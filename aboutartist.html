          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/logo.png" alt="" style="width:30%;">
          <p>I grew up in a small house in Jacksonville, Florida. Raised by my grandmother, me and my two sisters shared one room. While we didn’t have our mother, we had each other. From a young age, my grandmom encouraged us to follow our dreams, telling us that while we may never get rich, if we did what we loved we would have enough to live off of and would be happy.</p>
          <p>Art was in my blood from the beginning. My grandmom noticed my artistic talent at an early age and enrolled me in an art school to keep me off of the streets and learning. Fascinated by art, I loved studying people and objects, and continued with these endeavors up through high school. My artistic talent gained me popularity from the faculty and staff at my school, and the principal asked me to draw a mural of the entire administrative faculty on the walls of the school.</p>
          <p>After high school, my grandmother couldn’t afford to send us to college so I decided to join the United States Army. I hoped to be an illustrator, but instead ended up engaging in combat arms with the infantry. However, even after twenty-three years as well as the passing of my grandmother, I never gave up my dream of becoming a successful artist. I continue to work diligently to make that dream come true and believe this determination will one day pay off.</p>
